;;; Commentary:

;; company-mode support for `stan-mode'.
;; Completion keywords are obtained from `stan-mode'.
;;
;; Usage
;; The `company-stan-backend' needs to be added to `company-backends'.
;; This can be done globally or buffer locally (use here).
;;
;; A convenience function `company-stan-setup' can be added to the
;; mode-specific hook `stan-mode-hook'.
;; (add-hook 'stan-mode-hook #'company-stan-setup)
;;
;; With the `use-package', the following can be used:
;; (use-package company-stan
;;   :hook (stan-mode . company-stan-setup))
;;
;; If you already have a custom stan-mode setup function, you can add
;; the following to its body.
;; (add-to-list (make-local-variable 'company-backends)
;;              'company-stan-backend)
