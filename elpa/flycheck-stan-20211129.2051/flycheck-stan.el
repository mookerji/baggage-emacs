  "Enhances `rx' buffer locally with `flycheck' elements.

`flycheck' adds keywords `line', `column', `file-name',
`message', and `id' to `rx-constituents' defined in `rx.el'
to handle error message parsing.

The body was taken from `flycheck-rx-to-string'.

This function is intended for use in the `re-builder'
to enhance the pattern for interactive `rx' building."

;;; Define a parser
;;;  Regexp definitions
;;
;; flycheck uses extended `rx' to describe regexp.
;; `rx.el' is a built-in Emacs module for declarative regular
;; expressions. Look for the documentation of the `rx' function
;; inside Emacs for its usage. Flycheck extends `rx' with a few
;; constructs listed below. (taken from help for ).
;; These were taken from the docstring for `flycheck-rx-to-string',
;; which is used to convert these into string regexps.
;;
;; `line'
;;      matches the line number.
;; `column'
;;      matches the column number.
;; `(file-name SEXP ...)'
;;      matches the file name.  SEXP describes the file name.  If no
;;      SEXP is given, use a default body of `(minimal-match
;;      (one-or-more not-newline))'.
;; `(message SEXP ...)'
;;      matches the message.  SEXP constitutes the body of the
;;      message.  If no SEXP is given, use a default body
;;      of `(one-or-more not-newline)'.
;; `(id SEXP ...)'
;;      matches an error ID.  SEXP describes the ID.
;;
;; These are used in `flycheck-stan-parser' rather than in
;; :error-patterns.  A more conventional approach using regexps
;; in :error-patterns was not successful because the filename
;; part of all patterns overlap at the header.  This resulted
;; in only the first match being recognized due to the design
;; of `flycheck-tokenize-output-with-patterns'.
