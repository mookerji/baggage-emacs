;;; Commentary:

;; This is a major mode for the Stan modeling language for Bayesian
;; statistics.  (See URL `https://mc-stan.org/').

;; This major mode supports syntax-highlighting, indentation,
;; `imenu-mode', and `compilation-mode'.

;; Usage:

;;   (require 'stan-mode)
;;

;;; Code:

;; See `cc-langs.el' for how to develop a derived mode.
;; A small example of a derived mode is available at
;; <http://cc-mode.sourceforge.net/derived-mode-ex.el>.
;; It also contains some useful hints for derived mode developers.
;;
;; Real examples
;; Emacs mode for YANG (RFC 7950)
;;  https://github.com/mbj4668/yang-mode/blob/master/yang-mode.el
;; NVIDIA CUDA Major Mode
;;  https://github.com/chachi/cuda-mode/blob/master/cuda-mode.el

;; This `stan-mode.el' consists of elements extracted from `cc-langs.el'.

;; `cc-mode.el' is only needed for definition of `c-populate-syntax-table'.
;; Otherwise, we get the warning:
;; Warning: the function `c-populate-syntax-table' might not
;; be defined at runtime.
;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ccmode/index.html#Top
(require 'cc-mode)

;; These are only required at compile time to get the sources for the
;; language constants.  (The cc-fonts require and the font-lock
;; related constants could additionally be put inside an (
;; eval-after-load "font-lock" ...) but then some trickery is
;; necessary to get them compiled.)

  ;; This is intended to be used by modes that inherit CC Mode to add new

  ;; and BASE-MODE is the mode name symbol for the language in CC Mode that
  ;; is to be the template for the new mode.
  ;;
  ;; The exact effect of BASE-MODE is to make all language constants that
  ;; haven't got a setting in the new language fall back to their values in
  ;; BASE-MODE.  It does not have any effect outside the language constant
  ;; system.
  ;;
  ;; Make our mode known to the language constant system.  Use c-mode
  ;; mode as the fallback for the constants we don't change here.
  ;; This needs to be done also at compile time since the language
  ;; constants are evaluated then.

;; language, i.e. the mode name without the "-mode" suffix, or a list
;; of such language names, or t for all languages.  VAL is a form to

;; Neither NAME, LANG nor VAL are evaluated directly - they should not be

  "Define faces used in font locking in `stan-mode'.

This is used to set `font-lock-defaults' for `stan-mode'.

Note that the ones above have precedence over ones below.
The following faces are explicitly assigned here:
 - `font-lock-keyword-face'
 - `font-lock-constant-face'
 - `font-lock-function-name-face'
 - `font-lock-variable-name-face'
 - `font-lock-preprocessor-face'
 - `font-lock-type-face'
 - `font-lock-warning-face'

The `xr' function was used to generate these `rx' forms.
Evaluate the `rx' macro for to see the resulting regexp.

The data structure here is explained in the help for
`font-lock-keywords' defined in `font-lock.el'.
For each regular expression (MATCHER), the structure is
as follows:

  (MATCHER
   (SUBEXP1 FACENAME1 [OVERRIDE [LAXMATCH]])
   (SUBEXP2 FACENAME2 [OVERRIDE [LAXMATCH]])
   ...)

SUBEXP (1,2,etc) specifies the subexpression of the MATCHER
subject to the rule.  In the `rx' form, this corresponds
to the `group'.  See the `rx' expression for
`stan-regexp-at-param' as an example.

The font-lock system by default does not overwrite already
font-locked text.  When the optional OVERRIDE is t, it gets
overwritten.  Other options are keep, prepend, and append
as explained in the help for `font-lock-keywords'.

Note that this part represents the search-based font-lock,
which follows the higher priority syntactic font-lock.
The second deals with strings and comments.  Thus, overriding
these must occur explicitly.")
